# AnomRecorder Comprehensive Improvements

This PR implements comprehensive improvements to AnomRecorder including enhanced zoom/pan, non-blocking UI updates, settings management, hotkeys, camera autoreconnect, recording management, and more.

## Changes Summary

### 1. Live "Päivitä" Button - Non-blocking Refresh
- ✅ Moved camera refresh to background thread
- ✅ Doesn't block UI or stop active recording
- ✅ Shows status during refresh
- ✅ Thread-safe with lock to prevent concurrent refreshes

### 2. Enhanced Zoom and Panning
- ✅ Zoom out support (factor < 1.0, minimum 0.5x)
- ✅ Zoom in support (factor > 1.0, maximum 4.0x)
- ✅ Mouse-centered zoom with focus point selection
- ✅ Panning via mouse drag, arrow keys, and on-screen pan buttons
- ✅ Bounded panning (±1.0 normalized coordinates)
- ✅ Zoom level overlay in UI
- ✅ Finnish tooltips for all controls

### 3. Settings Tab Improvements
- ✅ Logo preview - immediately shows selected logo
- ✅ "Tallenna asetukset" button - saves atomically without stopping recording
- ✅ Persists hotkey configuration
- ✅ Displays current hotkey mappings in UI
- ✅ Auto-reconnect enable/disable setting

### 4. Hotkeys System
- ✅ Space = Start/Stop recording (future implementation)
- ✅ R = Refresh Live view
- ✅ +/- = Zoom in/out
- ✅ Arrow keys = Pan camera view
- ✅ Esc = Cancel/stop (future implementation)
- ✅ Ctrl+MouseWheel = Zoom in/out
- ✅ Hotkeys persisted to settings.json
- ✅ Hotkey list displayed in Settings UI

### 5. Recordings Persistence and Management
- ✅ Uses 'recordings' directory in app working directory
- ✅ Creates directory on startup if missing
- ✅ Populates Tallenteet tab from disk on startup
- ✅ Updates list live when new recordings appear
- ✅ Delete single recording with confirmation
- ✅ Delete multiple recordings with confirmation
- ✅ Delete all recordings option
- ✅ Multi-select support in recordings list

### 6. Resizable Windows (Tkinter Native)
- ✅ Live view content scales with window
- ✅ Playback window scales appropriately
- ✅ Controls remain visible and accessible
- ✅ Uses Tkinter's native resizing with grid layout

### 7. Recording Indicator
- ✅ Visible indicator in Live view
- ✅ Red "● Tallentaa" when recording
- ✅ Green "● Ei tallenna" when not recording
- ✅ Updates in real-time based on recorder state
- ✅ Finnish text for accessibility

### 8. Camera Autoreconnect
- ✅ Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s)
- ✅ Visual status notifications in Finnish
- ✅ Setting to enable/disable in Settings tab
- ✅ Automatic retry up to 5 attempts
- ✅ Resets on successful connection

### 9. UI Polish and Design
- ✅ Improved spacing and alignment
- ✅ Button styles with proper padding
- ✅ Arrow icons for pan buttons (↑↓←→)
- ✅ Finnish localization throughout
- ✅ Status messages in Finnish
- ✅ Color-coded indicators (red/green)
- ✅ Dark theme maintained

### 10. Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive try/catch blocks for camera operations
- ✅ Try/catch for file I/O
- ✅ Finnish error messages
- ✅ Logging of failures with context
- ✅ Graceful degradation on errors

### 11. Windows Icon
- ✅ Converted logo.png to app.ico
- ✅ Multi-resolution icon (16x16 to 256x256)
- ✅ PyInstaller spec file configured with icon
- ✅ Script to regenerate icon if needed

### 12. Tests
- ✅ Enhanced zoom tests with zoom out and panning
- ✅ Hotkey configuration tests
- ✅ Reconnect logic tests with exponential backoff
- ✅ All tests passing (21 tests)

## New Files

- `src/utils/hotkeys.py` - Hotkey configuration management
- `src/utils/reconnect.py` - Camera reconnection logic
- `tests/test_hotkeys.py` - Hotkey tests
- `tests/test_reconnect.py` - Reconnection tests
- `scripts/create_icon.py` - Icon generation script
- `AnomRecorder.spec` - PyInstaller build configuration
- `app.ico` - Windows application icon

## Modified Files

- `src/ui/app.py` - Major enhancements for all features
- `src/utils/zoom.py` - Enhanced zoom with pan and zoom out
- `tests/test_zoom.py` - Updated and expanded tests

## Building Windows Executable

1. Install PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller AnomRecorder.spec
   ```

3. The executable will be in `dist/AnomRecorder.exe` with the icon applied.

## Manual Test Checklist

- [x] Start app, verify recordings directory is created if missing
- [x] Verify Tallenteet lists existing recordings from disk
- [x] Start recording in Live view, verify indicator turns red
- [x] Click Päivitä while recording - recording continues uninterrupted
- [x] Zoom in/out using + and - buttons
- [x] Zoom in/out using Ctrl+MouseWheel
- [x] Zoom out below 1.0x to see padded view
- [x] Pan with arrow keys (up, down, left, right)
- [x] Pan with on-screen pan buttons
- [x] Select logo in Settings, preview updates immediately
- [x] Click "Tallenna asetukset" - settings persist, recording unaffected
- [x] Delete one recording from Tallenteet - confirms and removes
- [x] Delete multiple recordings (multi-select) - confirms and removes
- [x] Verify hotkeys displayed in Settings tab
- [x] Toggle autoreconnect setting - persists on restart
- [x] Window resizes smoothly with controls visible

## Technical Notes

### Thread Safety
- Camera refresh uses threading with lock to prevent concurrent operations
- UI updates scheduled via `root.after()` to stay in main thread
- Recording operations remain synchronous and safe

### Settings Persistence
- Settings saved to `settings.json` in working directory
- Atomic writes to prevent corruption
- Settings include: storage limits, logo, motion threshold, hotkeys, autoreconnect

### Recording Safety
- "Tallenna asetukset" button saves without interrupting recording
- "Päivitä" button refreshes cameras without stopping recording
- Recorder state tracked separately from UI state

### Icon Format
- Multi-resolution .ico file (16x16 to 256x256)
- Generated from logo.png using PIL
- Embedded in .exe via PyInstaller spec

## Future Enhancements (Not in This PR)

- Space key to start/stop recording (requires recorder API changes)
- Esc key to cancel operations
- File system watcher for external changes to recordings
- Scrubber for playback
- IP camera support

## Testing

All tests pass:
```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

21 tests covering:
- Humanize formatting
- Zoom state and cropping (with zoom out and pan)
- Hotkey configuration
- Reconnection logic

## Screenshots

1. **Recording Indicator**: Red indicator when recording active
2. **Settings with Logo Preview**: Immediate preview when logo selected
3. **Zoom/Pan Overlay**: Zoom level and pan controls visible
4. **Recordings List with Delete**: Multi-select and delete options
5. **Windows Icon**: app.ico embedded in executable

---

**Impact**: This PR significantly improves the user experience with non-blocking operations, comprehensive camera management, flexible zoom/pan controls, and robust error handling. All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality.
