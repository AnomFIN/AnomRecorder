# Pull Request Summary

## Title
Fix live freeze, improve zoom/pan, settings save and recording safety; add recording indicator, hotkeys and autoreconnect

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive bug fixes and feature enhancements for AnomRecorder, focusing on stability, user experience, and advanced camera controls.

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Priority A — Critical Fixes (COMPLETE)

#### 1. Non-Blocking Camera Refresh
- **Problem**: "Päivitä" button froze UI and could disrupt recordings
- **Solution**: Threading with UI updates via `root.after()`
- **Benefits**: 
  - UI remains responsive
  - Active recordings continue uninterrupted
  - Toast notifications provide feedback
  - Error handling with Finnish messages

#### 2. Safe Settings Save
- **Problem**: Settings changes might affect active recordings
- **Solution**: Atomic JSON file writes, no camera/recording state modification
- **Benefits**:
  - "Tallenna asetukset" button for explicit save
  - Recordings continue during save
  - Toast confirmation on success

#### 3. Persistent Recordings List
- **Problem**: Recordings list lost on restart
- **Solution**: Load from `./recordings/` on startup, continuous file watcher
- **Benefits**:
  - Existing recordings appear immediately
  - New files detected every 5 seconds
  - Multi-select delete with confirmation
  - Safe deletion (send2trash on Windows)

### ✅ Priority B — Important Features (COMPLETE)

#### 4. Zoom and Panning
- **Implementation**:
  - Zoom range: 0.5x (zoom out) to 4.0x (zoom in)
  - Zoom out adds black padding
  - Pan: -1.0 to 1.0 constrained offsets
  - Pan buttons (←, ↑, ↓, →) and keyboard arrows
- **Tests**: 5 comprehensive tests added
- **Benefits**: Professional camera control matching commercial software

#### 5. Recording Indicator
- **Implementation**:
  - Canvas widgets with colored dots per camera
  - Red = recording, Green = idle
  - Finnish tooltips on hover
- **Benefits**: Instant visual feedback of recording state

#### 6. Logo Preview & Settings Save
- **Implementation**:
  - Immediate preview on logo selection (max 200x100)
  - "Tallenna asetukset" button persists all settings
- **Benefits**: What-you-see-is-what-you-get for logo configuration

#### 7. Hotkeys
- **Mappings**:
  - `+` / `-`: Zoom in/out
  - Arrow keys: Pan view
  - `Esc`: Reset zoom/pan
  - `R`: Refresh cameras
  - `Space`: Reserved for future use
- **Documentation**: Listed in Settings tab with Finnish descriptions

#### 8. Camera Autoreconnect
- **Implementation**:
  - Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s (max 60s)
  - Up to 6 attempts per cycle
  - Settings toggle to enable/disable
- **Benefits**: Automatic recovery from camera disconnections

### ✅ Priority C — Polish and Packaging (COMPLETE)

#### UI Polish
- Recording indicators with clear colors
- Pan control buttons
- Hotkey reference in Settings
- Consistent Finnish labels

#### Icon & Packaging
- `convert_icon.py` script for logo.ico generation
- Multi-size icon (16x16 to 256x256)
- `ICON_GUIDE.md` documentation
- Existing `build.bat` already configured

#### Tests & Documentation
- 9/9 tests passing
- No flake8 syntax errors
- CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities
- `FEATURES.md`: Comprehensive feature guide
- Code review feedback addressed

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Threading**: Camera operations run in daemon threads
- **UI Updates**: Thread-safe via `root.after()` callbacks
- **State Management**: Reconnect attempts and timing tracked per camera
- **File Watching**: Periodic check every 5 seconds (non-blocking)

### Code Quality
- **Tests**: 9 unit tests (4 humanize + 5 zoom/pan)
- **Linting**: Flake8 clean
- **Security**: CodeQL scan passed
- **Documentation**: 3 new markdown files

### Performance
- No UI blocking operations
- Efficient numpy operations for zoom/pan
- Minimal memory overhead for state tracking
- Configurable intervals for file watcher and reconnect

## Files Changed

### Modified
- `src/ui/app.py` (+302 lines): Main UI with all features
- `src/utils/zoom.py` (+57 lines): Enhanced zoom/pan math
- `tests/test_zoom.py` (+34 lines): New zoom/pan tests

### Added
- `convert_icon.py`: Icon conversion utility
- `logo.ico`: Windows application icon
- `FEATURES.md`: Feature implementation guide
- `ICON_GUIDE.md`: Icon conversion guide
- `PR_SUMMARY.md`: This document

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Critical Flows
- [ ] Click "Päivitä" while recording - recording continues
- [ ] Change settings and save - recording continues
- [ ] Restart app - recordings list loads from disk
- [ ] Select multiple recordings - delete works with confirmation
- [ ] Disconnect camera during recording - autoreconnect activates

### Zoom/Pan
- [ ] Zoom out to 0.5x - black padding appears
- [ ] Zoom in to 4.0x - center crop appears
- [ ] Pan buttons move view correctly
- [ ] Arrow keys pan view
- [ ] Esc resets zoom and pan
- [ ] Zoom level displays correctly (e.g., "1.5x")

### Indicators & Feedback
- [ ] Recording dots turn red when recording starts
- [ ] Recording dots turn green when recording stops
- [ ] Hover over dots shows Finnish tooltip
- [ ] Toast appears on successful settings save
- [ ] Toast appears on camera refresh completion

### Hotkeys
- [ ] Press + to zoom in
- [ ] Press - to zoom out
- [ ] Arrow keys pan view
- [ ] Esc resets view
- [ ] R refreshes cameras

## Breaking Changes
**None** - All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Notes
- Existing settings.json will be extended with new fields on first save
- Existing recordings in `./recordings/` will be loaded automatically
- No user action required for migration

## Security Summary
- ✅ CodeQL scan: 0 vulnerabilities detected
- ✅ No new external dependencies added
- ✅ All file operations use safe paths
- ✅ Thread-safe UI updates

3. Zoom/pan controls and zoom level indicator
4. Recordings list with multiple items and delete buttons
5. Settings tab showing hotkey reference section
6. Built .exe icon in Windows Explorer (or build log)

## Recommendations for Future Work
1. Mouse wheel zoom support
2. Click-and-drag panning
3. Customizable hotkeys in Settings UI
4. Manual recording start/stop button
5. Recording metadata editing
