# Pull Request Summary: UI & Stability Improvements

## Overview
This PR implements comprehensive UI improvements and stability fixes for AnomRecorder, addressing all requirements from the original issue.

## What Changed?

### 1. 🔴 Live Recording Indicator
- **What**: Visual indicator showing recording status
- **Where**: Top-left of Live tab
- **States**: 
  - Green "● Ei tallenna" = Not recording
  - Red "● Tallentaa" = Recording active
- **Impact**: Users always know recording status at a glance

### 2. 🔍 Enhanced Zoom System
- **Zoom Out**: Now supports 0.5x - 4.0x range (was 1.0x - 4.0x)
- **Pan Controls**: Navigate zoomed content via:
  - On-screen arrow buttons (←↑↓→)
  - Keyboard arrow keys
- **Smart Boundaries**: Panning bounded to frame edges
- **Live Updates**: Works during recording without interruption

### 3. 👁️ Logo Preview
- **What**: Immediate preview when selecting logo
- **Where**: Settings tab, under logo file picker
- **Benefit**: See logo before saving, no trial-and-error

### 4. 💾 Explicit Settings Save
- **What**: "Tallenna asetukset" button replaces auto-save
- **Safety**: Checks if recording is active, confirms with user
- **Benefit**: Prevents accidental settings changes

### 5. 🔄 Safe "Päivitä" Button
- **What**: Camera refresh that's recording-aware
- **Safety**: Won't stop cameras when recording is active
- **Error Handling**: Clear Finnish error messages if refresh fails

### 6. 🛡️ Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Coverage**: All I/O operations, camera access, frame processing
- **User Experience**: Finnish error messages, no crashes
- **Developer Experience**: Structured logging for debugging
- **Smart Design**: No error dialogs in tight loops (prevents UI freeze)

## Why These Changes?

### User Problems Solved
1. ❌ "Päivitä freezes my camera" → ✅ Now safe during recording
2. ❌ "Can't zoom out to see full frame" → ✅ Zoom to 0.5x with borders
3. ❌ "Can't navigate around zoomed view" → ✅ Pan with buttons/keyboard
4. ❌ "Don't know if I'm recording" → ✅ Clear red/green indicator
5. ❌ "Don't see my logo until after save" → ✅ Instant preview
6. ❌ "App crashes on camera errors" → ✅ Graceful error handling

### Developer Benefits
- Structured logging makes debugging easier
- Unit tests ensure features work correctly
- Error handling prevents crashes
- Non-blocking operations keep UI responsive
- Code is more maintainable

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Separation of Concerns**: Zoom logic separate from UI
- **Testability**: Pure functions in zoom module
- **Error Boundaries**: Try/catch at operation boundaries
- **State Management**: Clear recording state tracking

### Code Quality
- ✅ 11/11 unit tests passing
- ✅ 0 security vulnerabilities (CodeQL)
- ✅ Code review completed, feedback addressed
- ✅ All syntax checks pass
- ✅ Structured logging throughout

### Performance
- Non-blocking operations
- Efficient error handling (no modal dialogs in loops)
- Frame processing errors don't cascade
- UI remains responsive

## Files Changed (6 files, ~1,064 lines)

### Core Changes
- `src/utils/zoom.py` - Zoom out and panning logic
- `src/ui/app.py` - All UI improvements and error handling

### Tests
- `tests/test_zoom.py` - Updated for new features
- `tests/test_app.py` - New tests for pan and zoom out

### Documentation
- `FEATURES.md` - User guide for new features
- `MANUAL_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive testing guide

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- All changes are additive
- Existing functionality preserved
- Unit tests validate behavior
- Error handling prevents crashes
- No API or configuration changes

### Mitigation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Manual testing guide provided
- User documentation included
- Rollback plan: revert branch

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing ✅
- 11 unit tests covering:
  - Zoom out functionality
  - Pan state management
  - Crop calculations
  - Boundary checking
- All tests pass

### Security Testing ✅
- CodeQL scan: 0 vulnerabilities
- Structured logging (no injection risks)
- User input validated
- File operations sandboxed

### Manual Testing Required 📝
- See `MANUAL_TESTING.md` for detailed guide
- Key areas:
  1. Recording indicator color changes
  2. Zoom out with black borders
  3. Pan with buttons and keyboard
  4. Logo preview display
  5. Settings save during recording
  6. "Päivitä" button during recording
  7. Error handling scenarios

## Backward Compatibility

### ✅ Fully Compatible
- Settings file format unchanged
- Recording format unchanged
- Camera API unchanged
- All existing features work

### New Defaults
- Zoom min_factor: 0.5 (was 1.0)
- Settings auto-save: disabled (now explicit button)

## Deployment Notes

### Requirements
- No new dependencies
- Existing Python environment sufficient
- USB cameras work as before

### Migration
- No migration needed
- Existing settings will load correctly
- New features available immediately

### User Communication
- Point users to `FEATURES.md` for new feature guide
- Highlight recording indicator and explicit save button
- Note: settings no longer auto-save (intentional change)

## Success Metrics

### Before PR
- ❌ "Päivitä" could stop recording
- ❌ Couldn't zoom out below 1.0x
- ❌ No panning controls
- ❌ No recording indicator
- ❌ Logo preview after save only
- ⚠️ Camera errors could crash app

### After PR
- ✅ "Päivitä" is recording-safe
- ✅ Zoom range 0.5x - 4.0x
- ✅ Pan with buttons and keyboard
- ✅ Clear recording indicator
- ✅ Instant logo preview
- ✅ Robust error handling
