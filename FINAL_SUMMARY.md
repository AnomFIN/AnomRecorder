## How to Proceed

### Step 1: Open PR
Visit: https://github.com/AnomFIN/AnomRecorder/compare/main...copilot/fix-live-zoom-settings-recording-indicator-another-one

Or follow instructions in `PR_CREATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 2: Manual Testing
Use `MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` to verify:
- All features work as expected
- No regressions
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance is acceptable

### Step 3: Add Screenshots
Capture and attach:
- Recording indicator (red/green states)
- Pan controls with arrows
- Audio settings section
- Autoreconnect toggle
- Delete recordings button
- Zoom overlay display

### Step 4: Review & Merge
- Address any code review feedback
- Verify CI passes (if configured)
- Merge to main when approved

## Known Limitations

These are documented and expected:

1. **Audio Capture**: UI is ready, but actual audio recording in `RollingRecorder` needs additional pipeline work
2. **Mouse-Centered Zoom**: Currently centers on frame center (not mouse position)
3. **Mouse Drag Pan**: Only keyboard and buttons (not mouse drag)
4. **Ctrl+Wheel Zoom**: Not implemented
5. **Screenshots**: Cannot be captured in headless environment

None of these limit the core functionality. They are potential future enhancements.

---

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture
- **Functional core, imperative shell** maintained
- **Thread-safe** operations for camera I/O
- **Atomic writes** for data integrity
- **Event-driven** with filesystem watchers

### Dependencies
- `send2trash` for cross-platform trash support
- `watchdog` for filesystem monitoring
- Pure Python implementation (no additional C deps)

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints where appropriate
- Finnish user-facing strings
- Error handling with user feedback
- Following repository patterns
